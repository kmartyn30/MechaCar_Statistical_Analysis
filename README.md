## Linear regression to Predict MPG
    The linear regression model is on a dataset containing 50 mpg test results for fifty MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were bsed on the idea 
    performance of each vehicle. As you can see the dataset first was set to pass the first six variables in the dataset.

    In our analysis, We implemented the funciton of lm() to create the data frame. This then implicated the variables and correlation to the coefficients 
  with r-values as multiple R-squared" 0.7085 which is utilized as a powereful tool to determine the quantified realtion between the variables and 
  predicatively can be utilized as a influencial decision making within the prcess baed on the meanfulness to the model.
   
  The R-squared is 0.7085 which is 71% approzimately of the variables of the dependnet variables which is moderate strength correlation.  The p-value of our linear regression model is 2.767e-06, (2.76 x 10 to the 6th power) which is least than the assused 0.05%. Therefore it results a slope of the linear model not being zero, in turn it is suffiencent to reject the null hypythosis. The adjusted R-squared as 0.6524 which means there is a likelihood that the probablity that the date points will fit the linear model.  
    
    As you can see in the data for the multiple linear regression model for predictive modeling tool to measure p-value as 2.767e-06 so that this will be a fail to reject the null hypothesis which quantifies suffiencent level to reject the null hypothesis of the paired t-test. This implicates there is limited to no distribution difference across the mpg dataset. A well designed linear regression model should approximate the two data points with a strong interrelationship within the two or more data variables points. 
   
   The Slope of the linear model as you can see is not considered to be 0 due to interrelated performance. 
   
  In the linear model,  Pr(>|t|) value that each coefficent contribution to a random amount of variance to the model. The mpg Pr(>|t|) implicates that the random amounts. 
    
    
 The Liner model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes can be see as

 Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:
 
 Total summary of suspension coils calcluating the mean, mode, variance and standard deviation. The total summary data for suspension PSI mean was 1,498.78. the median was 1500, the varience was 62.29356 and the standard deviation was 7.892627. Now lets compare to the three manufacturing lots.
 

Summary

  As you can see within the total summary the 1 manufacturing lot mean was 1500 and meadian was the same 1500. The summary mean was in a close range. while the median was exactly on target. The variance for lot 1 was 0.9795918 which was dynamically in a different level from the summary. The standard deviation was 0.9897433 again lowed than the trending summary. Manufacturing lot 2 mean consisted of 1,500.20 similarly to the summary and lot 1. Lot 2 mean was exactly the same as lot 1 1,500.0 however the varience was 7.4693878 slightly highter than manufacture lot 1 and low than the summary.  The standard deviation was 2.7330181 which reflected highter level than lot 1 however lower than the summary. 
 Lastly. Manufacturing lot 3 mean was 1,496.14 close to that of the summary and lot 1 and 2. The median was 1,498.50 similarly the same. The varience was 170.2861224which was very high comparable to the two manufacturing datasets and the summary.

The MechaCar suspension coils imposed that the varience must not out perform the 100 pounds per square inch for the suspension coils. The prevailing manufacturing data             this designs specification baed on the three manufacturing lots.
