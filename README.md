## Linear regression to Predict MPG
    The linear regression model is on a dataset containing 50 mpg test results for fifty MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were bsed on the idea 
    performance of each vehicle. As you can see the dataset first was set to pass the first six variables in the dataset.

    In our analysis, We implemented the funciton of lm() to create the data frame. This then implicated the variables and correlation to the coefficients with r-values as multiple R-squared" 0.7085 which is utilized as a powereful tool to determine the quantified realtion between the variables and predicatively can be utilized as a influencial decision making within the prcess baed on the meanfulness to the model.
   
    SUMMARY

  The R-squared is 0.7085 which is 71% approzimately of the variables of the dependnet variables. The p-value of our linear regression model is 2.767e-06, 
(2.76 x 10 to the 6th power) which is least than the assused 0.05%. Therefore it results a slope of the linear model not being zero, in turn is is 
suffiencent to reject the null hypythosis. 
  The adjusted R-squared as 0.6524 which means there is a likelihood that the probablity that the date points will fit the linear model. 
  Therefore 
    
    As you can see in the data for the multiple linear regression model for predictive modeling tool to measure p-value as 2.767e-06 so that this will be a fail to reject the null hypothesis which quantifies suffiencent level to reject the null hypothesis of the paired t-test. This implicates there is limited to no distribution difference across the mpg dataset. 
   
   The Slope of the linear model as you can see is not considered to be 0 due to 
    
    
 The Liner model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes can be see as

The MechaCar suspension coils imposed that the variaence must not outperforne the 100 pounds per square inch for the suspesion coils. The prevailing manufacturing data             this designs specification baedon the lot total for manufacturing lots and indivdual lot seperatly.
