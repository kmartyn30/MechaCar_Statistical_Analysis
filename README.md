## Linear regression to Predict MPG
    The linear regression model is on a dataset containing 50 mpg test results for fifty MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were bsed on the idea performance of each vehicle. As you can see the dataset first was set to pass the first six variables in the dataset.
  
  Linear regression predict mpg

    In our analysis, We implemented the funciton of lm() to create the data frame. This then implicated the variables and correlation to the coefficients with r-values as multiple R-squared" 0.7085 which is utilized as a powereful tool to determine the quantified realtion between the variables and predicatively can be utilized as a influencial decision making within the prcess baed on the meanfulness to the model.

The R-squared is 0.7085 which is 71% approzimately of the variables of the dependnet variables. The p-value of our linear regression model is 2.767e-06, 
(2.76 x 10 to the 6th power) which is least than the assused 0.05%. Therefore it results a slope of the linear model not being zero, in turn is is 
suffiencent to reject the null hypythosis. 
        
    
   
    
    
 The adjusted R-squared as 0.6524 which means there is a likelihood that the probablity that the date points will fit the linear model. 
    Therefore 
    
    As you can see in the data for the multiple linear regression model for pur predictive modieling tool to measure
